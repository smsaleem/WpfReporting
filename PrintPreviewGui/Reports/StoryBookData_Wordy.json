    "Title": "Effects of Global Warming",
    "Story": "The planet is warming, from North Pole to South Pole. Since 1906, the global average surface temperature has increased by more than 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) \u2013 even more in sensitive polar regions. And the impacts of rising temperatures aren’t waiting for some far-flung future \u2013 the effects of global warming are appearing right now. The heat is melting glaciers and sea ice, shifting precipitation patterns, and setting animals on the move.\nMany people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems. Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\nScientists already have documented these impacts of climate change:\nIce is melting worldwide, especially at the Earth’s poles. This includes mountain glaciers, ice sheets covering West Antarctica and Greenland, and Arctic sea ice. In Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park the number of glaciers has declined to fewer than 30 from more than 150 in 1910.\nMuch of this melting ice contributes to sea-level rise. Global sea levels are rising 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year. The rise is occurring at a faster rate in recent years and is predicted to accelerate in the coming decades.\nRising temperatures are affecting wildlife and their habitats. Vanishing ice has challenged species such as the Adélie penguin in Antarctica, where some populations on the western peninsula have collapsed by 90 percent or more.\nAs temperatures change, many species are on the move. Some butterflies, foxes, and alpine plants have migrated farther north or to higher, cooler areas.\nPrecipitation (rain and snowfall) has increased across the globe, on average. Yet some regions are experiencing more severe drought, increasing the risk of wildfires, lost crops, and drinking water shortages.\nSome species\u2013including mosquitoes, ticks, jellyfish, and crop pests\u2013are thriving. Booming populations of bark beetles that feed on spruce and pine trees, for example, have devastated millions of forested acres in the U.S...",

    "Title": "What is Food Security?",
    "Story": "Based on the 1996 World Food Summit, food security is defined when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.The four main dimensions of food security:\n\nPhysical availability of food: Food availability addresses the “supply side” of food security and is determined by the level of food production, stock levels and net trade.\nEconomic and physical access to food: An adequate supply of food at the national or international level does not in itself guarantee household level food security. Concerns about insufficient food access have resulted in a greater policy focus on incomes, expenditure, markets and prices in achieving food security objectives.\nFood utilization: Utilization is commonly understood as the way the body makes the most of various nutrients in the food. Sufficient energy and nutrient intake by individuals are the result of good care and feeding practices, food preparation, diversity of the diet and intra-household distribution of food. Combined with good biological utilization of food consumed, this determines the nutritional status of individuals.\nStability of the other three dimensions over time: Even if your food intake is adequate today, you are still considered to be food insecure if you have inadequate access to food on a periodic basis, risking a deterioration of your nutritional status. Adverse weather conditions, political instability, or economic factors (unemployment, rising food prices) may have an impact on your food security status.\nFor food security objectives to be realized, all four dimensions must be fulfilled simultaneously.\n\nStrategy:\nThe World Bank Group works with partners to build food systems that can feed everyone, everywhere, every day by improving food security, promoting ‘nutrition-sensitive agriculture’ and improving food safety. The Bank is a leading financier of food systems. In fiscal year 2022, there was US$9.6 billion in new IBRD/IDA commitments to agriculture and related sectors\n\nActivities include:\nStrengthening safety nets to ensure that vulnerable families have access to food and water\u2013and money in their pockets to make vital purchases.\nDelivering expedited emergency support by fast-tracking financing through existing projects to respond to crisis situations.\nEngaging with countries and development partners to address food security challenges. Instruments include rapid country diagnostics and data-based monitoring instruments and partnerships such as the Famine Action Mechanism and the Agriculture Observatory.\nPromoting farming systems that use climate-smart techniques, and produce a more diverse mix of foods, to improve food systems’ resilience, increase farm incomes and enable greater availability and affordability of nutrient-dense foods.\nImproving supply chains to reduce post-harvest food losses, improve hygiene in food distribution channels, and better link production and consumption centers.\nApplying an integrated “One Health” approach to managing risks associated with animal, human and environmental health.\nSupporting investments in research and development that enable increasing the micronutrient content of foods and raw materials.\nAdvocating for policy and regulatory reforms to improve the efficiency and integration of domestic food markets and reduce barriers to food trade.\nWorking with the private sector, government, scientists, and others to strengthen capacities to assess and manage food safety risks in low and middle-income countries.\nSupporting long-term global food security programs: The Bank houses the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), a global financing instrument that pools donor funds and targets additional, complementary financing to agricultural development across the entire value chain.  Since its launch in 2010 by the G20 in response to the 2007-2008 food price crisis, GAFSP has reached over 13 million smallholder farmers and their families with over $1.3 billion in grant funding to 64 projects in 39 countries, $330 million to 66 agribusiness investment projects in 27 countries, and $13.2 million in small-scale grants to support producer organizations. Most recently, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, GAFSP allocated over $55 million of additional grant funding to on-going public sector and producer organization-led projects to support COVID-19 response and recovery.\nThe Bank also supports the CGIAR which advances agriculture science and innovation to boost food and nutrition security globally.",

    "Title": "Refugees, Asylum Seekers And Migrants",
    "Story": "Most people in the world have had the experience of leaving the place where they grew up. Maybe they will only move as far as the next village or city. But for some people, they will need to leave their country entirely \u2013 sometimes for a short time, but sometimes forever.\n\nEvery day, all over the world, people make one of the most difficult decisions in their lives: to leave their homes in search of a safer, better life.\n\nThere are many reasons why people around the globe seek to rebuild their lives in a different country. Some people leave home to get a job or an education. Others are forced to flee persecution or human rights violations such as torture. Millions flee from armed conflicts or other crises or violence. Some no longer feel safe and might have been targeted just because of who they are or what they do or believe \u2013 for example, for their ethnicity, religion, sexuality or political opinions.  \n\nThese journeys, which all start with the hope for a better future, can also be full of danger and fear. Some people risk falling prey to human trafficking and other forms of exploitation. Some are detained by the authorities as soon as they arrive in a new country. Once they’re settling in and start building a new life, many face daily racism, xenophobia and discrimination.\n\nSome people end up feeling alone and isolated because they have lost the support networks that most of us take for granted \u2013 our communities, colleagues, relatives and friends.\n\nWHY DO PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR COUNTRIES?\n\nThere are many reasons why it might be too difficult or dangerous for people to stay in their own countries. For example, children, woman and men flee from violence, war, hunger, extreme poverty, because of their sexual or gender orientation, or from the consequences of climate change or other natural disasters. Often people will face a combination of these difficult circumstances.\n\nPeople who leave their countries are not always fleeing danger. They might believe they have a better chance of finding work in another country because they have the education or capital to seek opportunities elsewhere. Others might want to join relatives or friends who are already living abroad. Or they might seek to start or finish their education in another country. There are lots of different reasons for people to start a journey to build a life in a new country.",
